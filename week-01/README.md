# Week 01 — Docker Core Principles

This week I focused on understanding the **philosophy and foundational concepts** behind Docker.

The report is provided as a PDF and covers:
- Why Docker was created
- Docker vs Virtual Machines
- Container concept and isolation
- Image immutability and layering
- Docker architecture and registries

This week served as the conceptual foundation for deeper runtime analysis in Week 02.
